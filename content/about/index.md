I am Nabarun Pal, a final year undergraduate student at Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee. I am an active contributor to various open source projects, prominently Open Source Functions as a Service framework called [firefly](https://github.com/firefly). I am passionate about software development. I can also talk about Internet of Things, Electronics, Robotics with equal spirit. My journey with the field of software and robotics started in my schooling days.

I represented the university in various competitions like Mercari Hackathon, Microsoft code.fun.do, ABU ROBOCON, Inter IIT Technical Meet, Delta Automation Challenge etc. and was involved in projects related to the above domains. I actively participate in conducting open lectures for students in the domains of Introductory Robotics, Control, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning through a curated community of around 2000 members, of which I was the Joint Secretary in the 2016-2017 session and Overall Coordinator for Software Systems used in all projects. The same session, I also headed the Web Development division of a campus magazine, IIT HeartBeat.

I spoke at PyData Delhi 2017 on Building Camera Based Intelligent Systems and at PyCon India 2017 on Building Microservices with Firefly. I was also invited by Google to be part of Google Developer Days Event and Solve For India Visakhapatnam, of which I could not attend the former due to the impending placement season. Apart from that, I speak in lectures and workshops organized by the flagship robotics group at Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee.

Deviating from the technical stuff, I am an avid reader of literature with genres thriller and mystery. Rabindranath Tagore, Arthur Conan Doyle and Dan Brown are my favorite authors. I also love to watch movies and TV shows in my free time (Netflix helps me a lot with this :) ).
